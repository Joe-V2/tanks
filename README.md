# Tanks
A one to four-player, PvE, top-down tank shooter - playable with Xbox 360 controllers!

Made for the ACW of the Agile-based Group Development module as part of my Master's degree, this Unity-based 2D cartoon shooter was designed and developed over two months, according to a quoted specification. Committing to a central repository across separate branches, my team and I navigated Git via the agile development philosophy to integrate our work progressively throughout development, creating the prototype available on the (releases page)[https://github.com/Joe-V2/tanks/releases/tag/v1.0.0].
